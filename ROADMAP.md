# ShipStabilityLib Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development for **ShipStabilityLib**, a C++ library for ship stability calculations. This is a personal project to implement what I personally learn, into a functional product and am planning to build a GUI out of it. It might be slow since I'm working on it personally, in my spare times.

The idea is to learn the theory from the books, and implement it into this library, so naturally I would need to write the tests case first, then implement the calculations out of them.

## Phase 1: Core Hydrostatics (Current, TBD)

- [ ] **Buoyant Force Calculation** (Archimedes' principle)
- [ ] **Equilibrium Check** (floating/sinking state)
- [ ] Basic unit tests for Chapter 1 - 4 functions
- [ ] Improved Doxygen documentation with diagrams

## Phase 2: TBD.
