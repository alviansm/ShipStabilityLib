# ShipStabilityLib

A **C++ library for ship stability calculations** based on core naval architecture principles.  

It provides ready-to-use functions for **weight, buoyancy, equilibrium, metacentric height (GM), and more**, making it easier to integrate stability checks into your simulation or maritime software.

> ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**  
> ShipStabilityLib is under active development. APIs and documentation may change frequently.

## Features

- Compute buoyant force using Archimedes' principle  
- Evaluate equilibrium difference (floating/sinking states)  
- Extendable modular design for future stability chapters  
- Tested with basic unit tests

## Roadmap

See ROADMAP.md for further details.

**ShipStabilityLib** is a C++ library for ship stability calculations. This is a personal project to implement what I personally learn, into a functional product and am planning to build a GUI out of it. It might be slow since I'm working on it personally, in my spare times.

The idea is to learn the theory from the books, and implement it into this library, so naturally I would need to write the tests case first, then implement the calculations out of them.
